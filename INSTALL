Building from source
====================

   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
   make
   
If you want statically linked binaries, throw the --enable-static for
configure. Note that statically linked binaries are not possible on all
platforms.

Once the compile is finished, you'll find binaries in the bin/ directory.


Installation
============

Edit the settings in install/install.cfg and run "make install".
