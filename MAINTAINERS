Community Contributors:

Paul Herman (www.frenchfries.net/paul/tripwire): Paul is almost solely
responsible for the meat of the 2.4.0.1 release. His work on the autoconf
and gcc 3.x support (among other things) has contributed to a much more
portable code base, and an easier place to start for adding additional
features. 

David LaPalomento: David kindly provided precompiled binaries on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux AS release 4 (Nahant Update 3) on IA-64.
