	* Bumped version to 2.3.1.
	
	* BSD support, thanks to Paul Herman <pherman@frenchfries.net>.
	The support was added for FreeBSD 4.2, your mileage may vary on
	other BSD's.
	
	* Fixed long standing bug with recurse=3

	* If TEMPDIRECTORY was missing trailing /, bad things could
	happen. Tripwire now appends a / if one isn't present. Thanks
	Jarno.

	* Fixed GLOBALEMAIL bug where no global emails would be sent
	unless there were emailto attributes somewhere in the policy
	file. Additionally, reports were being sliced to global
	recipients, despite the fact that global recipients should get
	the full report.

	* Fixed possible security problem with the handling of temp
	files. We now open temp files with O_EXCL set to make sure a
	particular file doesn't already exist. Thanks to Jarno for this
	suggestion and help via a patch.

	* Added the configuration file variable TEMPDIRECTORY. This
	variable can be set to the full path to where tripwire should
	write its temporary files. By default it is /tmp. Because /tmp has
	to be world writable, this isn't a good place for tripwire to
	write temporary files. Setting TEMPDIRECTORY to a directory with
	permissions 700 is much more secure. Updated man page with info on
	this variable.

	* Added the configuration file variable GLOBALEMAIL. This variable
	can be set to a list of email addresses which are semi-colon or
	comma separated. If a report is about to be emailed to addresses
	reaped from the policy file, it will also be emailed to the
	addresses in the GLOBALEMAIL list, allowing designation of one or
	more people to always get email reports. Updated the man page with
	info on this variable.

	* Began a convention of providing a "Solution:" line to all errors
	(exceptions) emitted by tripwire. Only the two latest error
	messages incorporate this convention, but all future ones will as
	well, and I hope to revist all current errors and retrofit them
	with Solution: lines as well.
